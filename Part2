###Where would recursion be the best option?###
 
#Recursion would be the best option when you have something that needs to repeat with some
#parameters inside of the repetition changing each time.
 

###When would it not?###
 
#Recursion wouldnâ€™t be as good of an option if the part of code that is repeating stays the
#same each time. This is because it could then be done much more efficiently using iteration
#most of the time.
 

###What are some specific examples of recursion that can work for you?###

#I would use recursion if I was making a program like a fractal tree or any other drawing using
#turtles where the parameters inside of the repetition need to be changed every time it is
#repeated.
